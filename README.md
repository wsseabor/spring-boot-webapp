# spring-boot-webapp
A java web app running Spring Boot as a mock project to register for classes online.
Using MySQL as a back end database and Vue.js for a front end framework.

This is an older project for a capstone class project that I'm going to refactor and improve upon. 
Further details coming as the project develops.

#TODO
- Actually a lot
